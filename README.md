# Restaurant Reviews App

## Get started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Set up HTTP Server:
  - Possible implementation with Python:  
  In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
  - You can also use [nmap/ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/guide/) or any other solution you like as long as you get a local server up and running!
