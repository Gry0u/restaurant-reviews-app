# Restaurant Reviews App
## Get started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Set up HTTP Server:
  - Possible implementation with Python:  
  In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
  - You can also use [nmap/ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/guide/) or any other solution you like as long as you get a local server up and running!

## Resources
### Leafletjs and MapBox
This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.  

### Starter Code
From [cloned repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1):
- initial HTML
- initial CSS styling
- data base helper functions
- scripts to fetch restaurants information and map.  

### Other
References used for styling and accessibility:
- [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- [aria](https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/)  
I also found help on implementing responsive design in this [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92dtrNU1GQc).
